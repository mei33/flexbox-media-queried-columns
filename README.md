# Responsive Flexbox without media queries

## What is it?
Nothing revolutionary, actually. All glory goes to [Temani Afif](https://css-only.art/) and his article [Responsive Layouts, Fewer Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/responsive-layouts-fewer-media-queries/) - I just wanted to find a way to automate the process of getting result function.

## Ok ok, what is it, actually?
This is a function _(getMediaQueriedColumnsCssFunc)_ which receives a 'breakpoint - columns amount' dictionary _(MediaQueriesDict)_ and lets you build responsive flexbox columns without media queries.

## Does someone need it?
Probably not, but it can be helpful in CSS-in-JS, where it will save you from writing long rules.
